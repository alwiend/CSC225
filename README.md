# CSC225
Course work for CSC 225 (term) Algorithms and Data Structures I

Topics include:

- Algorithm design techniques, time and space complexity, recurrence relations.
- Basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues.
- Sorting- including Selectionsort, Mergesort, Heapsort, and Radix Sort. A lower bound for comparison based sorting methods.
- Data structures for searching including binary search trees, sets, and hash tables.
- Data structures for graphs and some simple graph algorithms such as Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Shortest Path.
